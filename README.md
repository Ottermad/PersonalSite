PersonalSite
============
This is the github repository to my person website (http://attwoodthomas.me). It uses HTML5 to define the structure with
Sass providing the styling and PHP adding additional features such as include files. Running on a VPS, Node.js provides
intergration with the Sendgrid API allowing the use of the contact form (contact form is currently down, this will be 
updated when fixed).
